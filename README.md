# Design

## Colour Scheme

I designed my colour scheme, based on the Floral Design logo. The design I recieved from my client, this logo was previously used by my client for advertising and other buissness needs. Based on the colour of the logo I have designed the website. The pink colour gives users the feeling, they are visitong a safisticated flower e-comerce site. The grey color has a pink undertone wich matches well the main pink colour of the logo.

- I have used `#e6423d` for the most header and nav texts of the web pages.
- I have used `#806161` for side texts and paragraphs.
- I have used `rgba(230, 66, 61, 0.5)` as an opaque version of the main text colour.
- I have used `rgba(128, 97, 97, 0.4)` as an opaque version of the side text colour.
- I have used `rgba(230, 66, 61, 0.3)` for the lighter opaque colour of the footer.
- I have used plain white `#fff` for the white text in the dark background sections of the web pages.
- I have used plain white `#fff` for the white background for many sections of the web pages.
